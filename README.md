# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## The Ballad of the Console and the Developer

In the depths of night, with screen aglow,
A developer types, commands in tow.
React components dance and flow,
As states update, row by row.

"npm start," the minstrel cries,
And localhost before them lies.
The browser opens, no surprise,
As code transforms before their eyes.

Errors in red, warnings in gold,
The console speaks, both brave and bold.
Debugging tales, forever told,
Until solutions we behold.

From "create-react-app" born,
A project rises like the morn.
With hooks and props, the code adorned,
New features added, old ones mourned.

So build your app with joy and might,
Test every function, get it right.
Deploy with pride when stars are bright,
Your React app, a wondrous sight.

And when the build is clean and true,
Remember all you've journeyed through.
The ballad of your code anew,
Forever changing, forever you.
