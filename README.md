# Project Name

## Overview

[Brief description of the project - what it does, who it's for, and why it exists]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses TypeScript for type safety.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [project directory]
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Setup environment variables (if applicable)
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` with your configuration.

## Usage

[Describe how to use the application, including any important features or functionality]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
