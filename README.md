# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<!-- 
  Create React App provides a modern, zero-configuration development environment
  for building React applications. It includes:
  - Webpack for bundling
  - Babel for JavaScript transpilation
  - ESLint for code linting
  - Jest for testing
  - Development server with hot reloading
-->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

<!-- 
  The following scripts are pre-configured by Create React App
  to simplify common development tasks.
-->

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- 
  The development server includes:
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant feedback
  - Error overlay to catch runtime errors
  - Source maps for debugging
-->

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

<!-- 
  Testing is powered by Jest and React Testing Library.
  Tests automatically run when files change.
  The interactive mode allows for filtering which tests to run.
-->

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

<!-- 
  The production build process:
  - Minifies JavaScript and CSS
  - Adds content hashes for cache busting
  - Optimizes assets for performance
  - Creates static files ready for deployment to any static hosting service
-->

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- 
  Ejecting should be considered a last resort:
  - Only eject when you need custom configurations that CRA doesn't support
  - Once ejected, you'll need to maintain all configurations yourself
  - Future updates to Create React App won't benefit your project after ejection
  - Consider using alternatives like react-app-rewired before ejecting
