## 🥊 Roast Corner

* Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
* To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
* There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.
* Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

### 🧑‍💻 Personal Roast

* You commit directly to main because “YOLO” is your version control strategy.
* You think “clean code” means running Prettier and never looking back.
* Your Stack Overflow searches have their own browser tab group.
* You treat warnings like suggestions and errors like minor inconveniences.
* Your idea of code review is checking if it compiles before merging.
* You use TODO comments as a long-term storage solution.
* You still debug with console.log, but call it “observability.”
* You asked an AI to roast you—because even your imposter syndrome needed a second opinion.
