# Getting Started with Create React App

## 🔥 Roast Corner

> – Debugging your code is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you're gonna git.
> – Your code's so 'agile', it sprints in circles.
> – You call it a feature, users call it a scavenger hunt.
> – Your stack traces have more drama than a soap opera.
> – If copy-paste was an Olympic sport, you'd be on the podium.
> – Your backlog is so bloated, even Jira asked for a diet plan.
> – Your test coverage is like a summer tan—patchy and full of false confidence.
> – You refactor like you clean your room: just shuffle the mess into different corners.
> – Your procrastination game is so strong, even Git commits itself just to escape the waiting.
> – Your CSS is like your coffee: messy, and somehow still missing the important bits.
> – You deploy bugs with such confidence they should have their own LinkedIn profiles.
> – Your React components are so reusable, they're still waiting to be used... someday.
> – You treat "works on my machine" like it's an industry standard.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
