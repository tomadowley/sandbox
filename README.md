# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a modern React application development environment with TypeScript support, testing utilities, and optimized build configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher, included with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Git for version control

For the best development experience, we also recommend:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - React Developer Tools

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm commands to develop, test, and build your application:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with hot-reload enabled.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits to any source files.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console for immediate feedback.

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.\
The app renders into a `<div id="root"></div>` element defined in `public/index.html`.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode using Jest.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Tests are located in files with `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` extensions.\
The test environment is configured in `src/setupTests.ts` with support for React Testing Library.

When writing tests, remember:
- Component tests should focus on user interaction rather than implementation details
- Use `act()` from React for testing components with state changes
- Mock API calls and external dependencies to isolate component behavior

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes for efficient caching.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The production build removes development-specific code and optimizes asset sizes.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

After building, you can:
- Serve the build folder locally using `serve -s build` (install with `npm install -g serve`)
- Deploy to static hosting platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment workflows

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Create React App structure:

- `public/` - Contains static files like HTML, images, and other assets that don't require processing
  - `index.html` - The main HTML template with the root div where React mounts the application
  - `favicon.ico` - The website icon shown in browser tabs
  - `manifest.json` - Web app manifest for PWA capabilities
  
- `src/` - Contains the React application source code
  - `index.tsx` - Entry point that renders the App component into the DOM
  - `App.tsx` - Main application component that serves as the application shell
  - `App.test.tsx` - Tests for the App component using React Testing Library
  - `App.css` - Styles specific to the App component
  - `index.css` - Global styles applied to the entire application
  - `setupTests.ts` - Configuration for the test environment
  
- Configuration files in the root directory:
  - `package.json` - Defines project dependencies, scripts, and metadata
  - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with compiler options
  - `.gitignore` - Specifies files that Git should ignore

## Application Capabilities and Limitations

### Capabilities

This React application provides:

- A modern, component-based UI built with React 18's latest features:
  - Concurrent Rendering: Allows UI updates to be interrupted and prioritized
  - Automatic Batching: Automatically groups multiple state updates into a single re-render
  - Transitions API: Marks UI updates that don't require immediate user feedback
  - Suspense with SSR: Stream HTML and selectively hydrate components
  - New Hooks: useId, useTransition, useDeferredValue for advanced patterns
  - Improved Strict Mode: Helps identify potential issues with rendering logic
  
- Type safety throughout the codebase with TypeScript integration
- Fast development experience with hot module replacement
- Comprehensive testing tools for unit and integration tests
- Optimized production builds with code splitting and asset optimization

### Limitations

Be aware of the following constraints:

- The application uses client-side rendering by default; server-side rendering would require additional setup
- Internet Explorer is not supported; use modern browsers for the best experience
- For large-scale applications, you may need to implement state management solutions like Redux or Context API
- The default build setup has a maximum bundle size recommendation of ~244 KiB for optimal performance
