## 🥊 Roast Corner

* Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.
* A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?"
* There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.
* Why do programmers hate nature? It has too many bugs.
* Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.

### 🧑‍💻 Personal Roast

* You commit directly to main because “YOLO” is your version control strategy.
* You think “clean code” means running Prettier and never looking back.
* Your Stack Overflow searches have their own browser tab group.
* You treat warnings like suggestions and errors like minor inconveniences.
* Your idea of code review is checking if it compiles before merging.
* You use TODO comments as a long-term storage solution.
* You still debug with console.log, but call it “observability.”
* You asked an AI to roast you—because even your imposter syndrome needed a second opinion.
