# Arlo's Nightmare Feast

**Arlo's Nightmare Feast** is a gruesome, mobile-first, 8-bit horror game that throws you into a relentless chase for survival. Guide Arlo as he flees from the monstrous Ali, desperately collecting meat to stave off starvation. Every mistake is met with explicit, animated horror cutscenes—this is not a game for the faint of heart.
