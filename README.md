# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and
middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we
understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are
ready for it.

## Roast Corner 🔥

- Forgot a semicolon? Don't worry, JavaScript loves a good mystery as much as you do.
- Your code runs perfectly... as long as no one touches it, looks at it, or breathes near it.
- "It works on my machine"—the ancient proverb of debugging legends everywhere.
- Tests are failing? Must be a problem with the universe, not your latest commit.
- Your TODO comments have unionized and now demand a roadmap.
- If Stack Overflow ever goes down, so does your productivity graph.
- That feeling when you fix a bug by rearranging code—true modern art!
- You call it “quick refactoring”; your teammates call it “git blame fuel.”
- Who needs dark mode? Your codebase is already full of shadowy surprises.
- You thought `console.log` was temporary, but it's now your app’s main historian.
- Your “one-liner” functions really push the limits of vertical scrolling.
- Every merge conflict is just your code’s way of saying, “Notice me, senpai!”
- Your CSS “fixes” are a masterclass in hide-and-seek for page elements.
- You write comments like you’re leaving riddles for future generations.
- Your “final_final” branch count is approaching Fibonacci numbers.
- Every deployment is a mystery thriller: will it crash or just embarrass you?
- You treat warnings like gentle suggestions, not flashing neon signs.
- The only thing more recursive than your functions is your Google searches.
- Your local repo is a safe haven for abandoned experiments and half-baked dreams.
- You debug for hours, then fix it by just closing and reopening your IDE.
- Your “temporary” hacks have longer tenures than most CTOs.
- You comment out code like you’re creating modern cave paintings.
- You run `npm audit` for the thrill, not for the actual fixes.
- When in doubt, you add another dependency and hope for the best.
- Your `package.json` is a museum of libraries past and present.
- You name variables like you’re encrypting secret messages for yourself.
- You push straight to main because “YOLO” is a valid workflow, right?
- Your “quick fixes” have a habit of sticking around for several sprints.
- Your linter just gave up and started sending you inspirational quotes instead.
