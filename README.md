# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and
middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we
understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are
ready for it.

## Roast Corner 🔥

- Forgot a semicolon? Don't worry, JavaScript loves a good mystery as much as you do.
- Your code runs perfectly... as long as no one touches it, looks at it, or breathes near it.
- "It works on my machine"—the ancient proverb of debugging legends everywhere.
- Tests are failing? Must be a problem with the universe, not your latest commit.
- Your TODO comments have unionized and now demand a roadmap.
- If Stack Overflow ever goes down, so does your productivity graph.
- That feeling when you fix a bug by rearranging code—true modern art!

- Who needs dark mode? Your codebase is already full of shadowy surprises.
- Your feature branches are so long, Git considered them a novella.
- Every merge conflict you resolve is just a new plot twist in your saga.
- When you say “just one more deploy,” your WiFi gets nervous.
- You treat warnings like gentle suggestions—until they grow up to be bugs.

- Every time you push to main, the CI pipeline starts writing its memoirs.
- You’ve mastered copy-paste so well, your mouse applied for overtime pay.
- Your linter’s greatest wish? A long, peaceful vacation—far from your code.
- You’ve achieved “spaghetti code” status—time to open an Italian restaurant.
- Your “works for me” debugging style is now available as a paid workshop.
- Every hotfix is a patch on top of a patch—a true digital quilt.
- You say “minimal reproducible example,” but it’s mostly just minimal.
- Pair programming with you means double the confusion, half the solution.
- When you see a race condition, you bet on the wrong thread.
- Your codebase is a maze and you forgot to leave any breadcrumbs.
- You don’t fix bugs, you just comment them out for future generations.
- Every “final_v2_really_final” file lowers morale across the repo.
- Stack traces fear you more than you fear them.
- You call it “legacy code,” but it’s younger than your lunch.
- You use !important like it’s a punctuation mark.
- Your code is so asynchronous, it shows up late to its own functions.
- The only thing more mysterious than your code is your commit history.
- You treat “undefined” as a polite suggestion, not a warning.
- “Temporary fix” is your favorite design pattern.
- You believe every error is a feature in disguise.
- Refactoring for you means “find and replace” on a Friday at 4:59pm.
- You debug by rubber ducking, but the duck has filed for retirement.
- Your code is so dry, even comments are dehydrated.
- You think “self-documenting code” means no comments, no mercy.
