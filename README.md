# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a modern React application development environment with TypeScript support, testing utilities, and optimized build configurations.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm commands to develop, test, and build your application:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with hot-reload enabled.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits to any source files.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console for immediate feedback.

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.\
The app renders into a `<div id="root"></div>` element defined in `public/index.html`.

Under the hood, this command uses webpack-dev-server to bundle and serve the app.\
It also launches a WebSocket connection to enable the hot reload functionality.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode using Jest.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Tests are located in files with `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` extensions.\
The test environment is configured in `src/setupTests.ts` with support for React Testing Library.

Jest will automatically detect changes to your code and re-run affected tests.\
You can type `a` to run all tests, or `q` to quit the test runner.

For coverage reporting, you can run `npm test -- --coverage` to generate detailed reports.\
Coverage reports will be available in the `coverage/` directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes for efficient caching.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The production build removes development-specific code and optimizes asset sizes.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This command employs several optimization techniques:
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Code splitting to reduce initial load time
- Image compression to reduce asset sizes
- Minification and uglification to reduce file sizes

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

After ejecting, you'll have direct access to configure:
- Webpack for bundling customization
- Babel for JavaScript transpilation settings
- ESLint for code quality rules
- Jest for testing configuration
- PostCSS for CSS processing

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Create React App structure:

- `public/` - Contains static files like HTML, images, and other assets that don't require processing
  - `index.html` - The main HTML template that includes the root div where React mounts the application
    - Contains meta tags for SEO and mobile responsiveness

## Development Workflow

This project follows a standard React development workflow:

1. **Setup**: Install dependencies with `npm install` before starting development.\
   This will create a `node_modules` directory with all required packages.

2. **Development**: Run `npm start` to launch the development server.\
   Write your code in the `src` directory, creating components, hooks, and utilities as needed.

3. **Testing**: Write tests alongside your components and run them with `npm test`.\
   Follow a test-driven development approach for more robust code.

4. **Building**: When ready to deploy, use `npm run build` to create a production build.\
   This generates optimized assets in the `build` directory.

5. **Code Quality**: Maintain code quality by following established patterns:\
   - Use functional components with hooks for state management
   - Apply TypeScript types rigorously for better type safety
   - Follow the established project structure for consistency
   - Document complex logic with clear comments

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to various hosting platforms. Here's how to deploy to Firebase:

### Firebase Deployment Prerequisites

1. Install Firebase CLI globally:\
   `npm install -g firebase-tools`

2. Log in to Firebase:\
   `firebase login`

3. Initialize your Firebase project:\
   `firebase init`
   
   During initialization:
   - Select "Hosting" when prompted for features
   - Choose your Firebase project
   - Specify "build" as your public directory
   - Configure as a single-page app by answering "yes"
   - Don't overwrite "index.html"

### Deploying the Application

1. Build your production-ready application:\
   `npm run build`

2. Deploy to Firebase:\
   `firebase deploy`

3. Once deployed, Firebase will provide a URL where your application is hosted.\
   You can access your deployed application and share it with others.

For more detailed information on Firebase deployment options and customization,\
visit the [Firebase Hosting documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

### Deployment to Other Platforms

This React application can also be deployed to other platforms:

- **Vercel**: Optimized for Next.js but works well with Create React App
  - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
  - Vercel will automatically detect Create React App settings
  - Provides preview deployments for pull requests

- **Netlify**: Popular for static site hosting
  - Connect your repository or upload the build folder manually
  - Set the build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `build`
  - Offers branch deploys and deploy previews

- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for GitHub repositories
  - Add `homepage` field to package.json: `"homepage": "https://username.github.io/repo-name"`
  - Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
  - Add deploy scripts to package.json
  - Deploy with `npm run deploy`

## Environment Variables

You can customize the application behavior using environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file in the project root to define variables
- Variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` to be accessible in the React application
- Example: `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com`
- Access variables in code using `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`

Environment variables are embedded during the build process, so you need to rebuild\
the application after changing them.

Different environment files can be used for different environments:
- `.env`: Default environment variables for all environments
- `.env.local`: Local overrides, loaded for all environments except test
- `.env.development`: Development environment variables
- `.env.test`: Test environment variables
- `.env.production`: Production environment variables

The priority order is (highest to lowest):
1. `.env.local` (except for test environment)
2. `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production` (depending on environment)
3. `.env`

## TypeScript Support

This project is configured with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience:

- Use interfaces to define component props: `interface Props { name: string; }`
- Create type definitions for API responses and state
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference where possible
- Use union types for variables that can have multiple types: `type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'`
- Store reusable types in separate files in a `types/` directory

TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json` has been set up with best practices for React development.\
Adjust the configuration as needed for your specific requirements.

## Testing Strategy

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing:

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies and external services
- Focus on component behavior rather than implementation details

### Integration Tests
- Test how components work together
- Ensure data flows correctly between components
- Verify that user interactions produce expected results

### Test Commands
- `npm test`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm test -- --coverage`: Generate coverage report
- `npm test -- --testPathPattern=src/components`: Run tests only in the components directory
- `npm test -- -u`: Update snapshots

Write tests that simulate user behavior:
```tsx
test('user can submit the form', () => {
  render(<Form />);
  userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/name/i), 'John Doe');
  userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));
  expect(screen.getByText(/thank you/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
