# Image Placeholders

This directory would typically contain the following images for your website:

1. hero-bg.jpg - A high-quality image of the Bowl Chair for the hero section
2. about-image.jpg - An image showing your workshop or designers
3. chair-main.jpg - The main product image (preferably circular)
4. Various detail shots of the chair from different angles
5. Material close-ups
6. Design process images

For a production website, you would need to replace the CSS placeholders with actual images.
